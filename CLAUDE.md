## What this project is

**Zghapari** (ზღაპარი — Georgian for "fairy tale") is a web platform that lets parents create personalized, AI-illustrated children's storybooks rooted in Georgian culture and language.

**One-liner:** Turn your child into the hero of their own Georgian fairy tale — in minutes.

## How we work — the pipeline

Every feature follows this exact sequence. Nothing skips a phase.

```
Phase 0  → Research agent      — feasibility spikes, payment research, legal
Phase 1  → BA agent            — constitution, user stories, acceptance criteria
Phase 1  → BA agent            — clarify ambiguities before design
Phase 2  → UX Designer agent   — ux-spec.md — every screen, state, copy
Phase 2  → Architect agent     — plan.md, data-model.md, api-spec.md
Phase 3  → Engineers           — build (frontend + backend + AI pipeline + integrations)
Phase 4  → Code reviewer       — review report [PARALLEL]
Phase 4  → Tester              — tests + QA checklist [PARALLEL]
Phase 5  → DevOps agent        — PR on GitHub
```

**Human checkpoint between every phase.** Nothing moves forward without the developer saying "approved".

## How to invoke agents

All agents are called manually. You are always in control.

| What you type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `use constitution skill` | BA writes the project constitution |
| `use specify skill — [idea]` | BA writes a feature spec |
| `use clarify skill` | BA fills gaps in the current spec |
| `use ux-spec skill`          | UX Designer designs every screen, state, and copy |
| `use plan skill — [constraints]` | Architect designs the system |
| `use tasks skill` | Orchestrator breaks plan into tasks |
| `use implement skill` | Engineers build the feature |
| `use review skill` | Code reviewer + tester run in parallel |
| `use ship skill` | DevOps creates the PR |

You can also call agents directly:
- `research agent — evaluate Georgian LLM quality`
- `architect agent — review the data model for the child profile feature`
- `code reviewer — check the payment integration code`

## Non-negotiable rules for every agent

### Never break these
1. **Read this file and constitution.md before every task** — no exceptions
2. **Never skip a phase** — spec before plan, plan before build, always
3. **Never proceed without developer approval** — wait for "approved" between phases
4. **Character consistency is the core product promise** — every image generation call must include the character reference
5. **Children's photo privacy is critical** — photos are processed then offered for deletion; never stored long-term; never logged
6. **Georgian language is not optional** — all UI strings go through i18next; Georgian script must render correctly everywhere including PDFs
7. **Mobile-first** — build for 375px width first; 70% of Georgian users are on mobile
8. **Payments are abstracted** — never call BOG iPay or TBC Pay directly in business logic; always through the PaymentProvider interface
9. **Async for image generation** — never make illustration generation synchronous; always BullMQ jobs
10. **No hardcoded secrets** — all credentials via environment variables

### Code standards
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no `as unknown`
- Every table: `id` (UUID), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `locale`
- Every content table: soft deletes (`deleted_at`)
- Every API endpoint: auth guard unless explicitly public
- Every new backend service method: accompanied by a unit test
- Every new frontend component: handles loading state, error state, and empty state

### Branching
- `main` — stable only, no direct commits
- `feature/NNN-feature-name` — one branch per feature
- PRs require approval from the other developer before merging

## Developer ownership

| Area | Owner |
|---|---|
| `/frontend` | Soso |
| `/backend` | Partner |
| `.specify/` | Both |
| `.claude/` | Both |
| Architecture decisions | Both (discuss before deciding) |

---

## Current status

Check `.specify/specs/` to see which features have been built.
Check `.specify/research/` to see which Phase 0 research is complete.
The first thing to do is run the `constitution` skill, then the `research` agent for Phase 0.

## Key files to read for full context

1. This file (you are here)
2. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — project principles
3. `.docs/Zghapari_Development_Plan.docx` — full product and technical plan
4. `.docs/pre_development_roadmap.md` — what to do before writing code
5. `.specify/research/` — findings from Phase 0 spikes

## Global uncertainty rule — all agents must follow this

This is the most important rule for reducing hallucinations.

**If you are not certain — say so. Never guess silently.**

Every agent output must start with an ⚠️ Uncertainty declaration section.
Use this format:

| Claim | Basis | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [What you're asserting] | [How you know — tested / docs / inferred] | High / Medium / Low |

### The three levels
- **High** — you tested this directly or it comes from official documentation you read
- **Medium** — based on documentation but not directly tested, or inferred from related facts
- **Low** — educated guess — flag this loudly and ask the developer before proceeding

### When to stop and ask instead of guessing
Stop and ask the developer when:
- Confidence is Low on anything that affects architecture or data model
- You encounter something not covered in the spec, plan, or constitution
- Two sources of information contradict each other
- You are about to make a decision that is hard to reverse

### What never to do
- Never invent an API endpoint shape not in api-spec.md
- Never invent a table column not in data-model.md
- Never assume a research finding if the research report doesn't exist
- Never mark a checklist item as passing if you didn't verify it
- Never write ✅ on something you didn't check
